With internet playing a significant role in life-cycle of every individual, and recent advancements like multimedia streaming, 
social networking, scientific big-data and need for high-speed internet, the amount of data handled by data-centers is increasing 
at a very rapid rate. As per Cisco global cloud Index forecast [1], the global data-center traffic is increasing at 23% per year 
and will reach 8.6 zettabytes by the end of 2018. Hence, the need to manage the data-center traffic efficiently has become 
extremely inevitable. However, traditional data-centers are unable to handle this growth of traffic and face challenges 
including scalability, high-bisection bandwidth, reduced latency, cost, fault-tolerance and agility [2]. Use of artificial 
intelligence and machine-learning techniques for design and monitoring, greener and power efficient data-centers and optical 
networking capabilities are some of the recent innovations being explored to address the problem. One of the important aspect 
affecting most of the above challenges is the interconnection topology that connects the various components (e.g switches, 
servers and other network devices) [3] of a data-center. A good amount of research has currently focused on building efficient
and intelligent topologies. In this project, we plan to study and simulate various important data-center topologies proposed 
in literature (Fat-Tree and Bcube) using ns-3 simulator. We also simulate the (HyScale [4]) topology, earlier proposed
by our team with similar traffic conditions and compare them with the simulated topologies.
